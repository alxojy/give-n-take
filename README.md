## iNTUition v7.0
## Inspiration
**Unemployment due to Covid-19**  
Hundreds of thousands of Malaysians have lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, these Malaysians are suffering and undergoing extreme hardships to put food on the table for their families. 

**Improve existing donation system**  
Key problems of the existing system :
1. People in need are not receiving the right help - Charity organizations are incapable of catering to individual needs

2. Lack of transparency in the charity funds - Who are actually receiving the money ?

3. Time consuming process to apply for funds from larger organizations - There is a delay between requesting and receiving funds for those that require urgent support

We hope to build a platform that supports the common good and form a caring community.

## What it does  
This platform connects the people in need with kind-hearted individuals who will be able to support them

**Provide Transparency**
- Donator knows exactly who they are donating to, and what the receiver needs

**Eliminate the middle man**
- Donate directly to the people in need rather than through big organizations
- Simplify the donation process

**Promote the art of giving**
- A little goes a long way. A small contribution can have a big impact on others.

**Crowd funding for a single request**
- Multiple individuals can support / donate to a single request
